# Introduction 

In this project, we use python and computer vision to auto capture a selfie by detecting if the user is smiling or not. 

## Importing 

We first have to import some libraries in order for our code to work: 

```python
from scipy.spatial import distance as dist
from imutils.video import VideoStream, FPS
from imutils import face_utils
import imutils
import numpy as np
import time
import dlib
import cv2
```

## Facial landmark detector

Inside the dlib package, there is an API called the facial landmark detector. This API has 68 (x,y) coordinates which point to specific facial structures. Here are all the 68 points visualized:

Since we want to detect the user's smile, we want to focus on the points in the range [49, 68]. We get these features by using the following piece of code: 

```python
shape_predictor= "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" 
detector = dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()
predictor = dlib.shape_predictor(shape_predictor)

(mStart, mEnd) = face_utils.FACIAL_LANDMARKS_IDXS["mouth"]
```ยก

The first three lines load the .dat file and the last line extracts the coordinates that we want (the mouth in our case). You can download the .dat file from here: https://github.com/AKSHAYUBHAT/TensorFace/blob/master/openface/models/dlib/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat

## Working with the smile 

Now we just have the 20 coordinates that represent the mouth:

In order to detect if the user is smiling or not, we create a mouth aspect ratio (MAR). In order to calculate this ratio, we have to find: 

- the distance between p49 and p55 
- the distance between p51 and p59
- the distance between p52 and p58
- the distance between p53 and p57 

Here is the formula to find the MAR: 

* insert image* 

We can write a function in our code to perform to this calculation:

```python
def smile(mouth):
    A = dist.euclidean(mouth[3], mouth[9])
    B = dist.euclidean(mouth[2], mouth[10])
    C = dist.euclidean(mouth[4], mouth[8])
    avg = (A+B+C)/3
    D = dist.euclidean(mouth[0], mouth[6])
    mar=avg/D
    return mar
```

We also want to detect the mouth from the user's face, so in order to do this, we use our predictor we loaded in earlier: 


```python
for rect in rects:
        shape = predictor(gray, rect)
        shape = face_utils.shape_to_np(shape)
        mouth= shape[mStart:mEnd]
        mar= smile(mouth)
        mouthHull = cv2.convexHull(mouth)
        #print(shape)
        cv2.drawContours(frame, [mouthHull], -1, (0, 255, 0), 1)
```

With some experimentation, we "define" a smile to have a MAR value of <0.3
